### 📌 Description

This issue documents key concepts and learning outcomes from **Module 1** of the IBM *Cybersecurity Compliance and Framework* course.

The focus of this module is understanding the foundations of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0), compliance monitoring, automation, and change management in cybersecurity.

### Learning Objectives Covered

* [ ] Describe the **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** approach, including guidelines, policies, and standards.
* [ ] Describe the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)**, its components, and how it functions.
* [ ] Identify different levels of cybersecurity maturity and factors that determine an organization’s **CSF Tier**.
* [ ] Explain the consequences of non-compliance and methods for monitoring compliance to mitigate risks.
* [ ] State the importance of standardized processes across organizational domains.
* [ ] Explain automation and orchestration concepts, applications, and benefits in cybersecurity and operations.
* [ ] Describe change management policies and processes in relation to security.
